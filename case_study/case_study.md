>#### "The foundation for the democratization of private equity was the [global] financial crisis. After it occurred, GPs suddenly started to think about diversification of their LP base. One thing they came across was that there are all these individuals out there who are totally underallocated to private equity. **They began asking questions such as: How can we tap into the largest growth capital that's out there for private equity for diversification and for growth reasons? They wondered how they could access retail investors. And, frankly, no one came out with a clear solution."**

>#### "When I left KKR in 2015, I was calling my friends and asking them: 'I can't invest in PE alone, but maybe as a community we are stronger than an individual so join me and we can pool all our capital.' As individuals, we can make it to the $10 million threshold [required by KKR at the time], but my lawyers stopped me and said 'you can't just run around, this is a regulated industry.' **This is why I decided if you can't do it alone, you do it as a community—and Moonfare was born**."

## Moonfare's Audience: "Welcome to Private Equity"
   Moonfare's marketing depicts clientele that are younger than the industry average and/or female. It hopes to attract new private equity investors with campaigns of well-dressed urban professionals performing mundane daily rituals like [eating a hamburger](https://fiu-original.b-cdn.net/fontsinuse.com/use-images/N195/195835/195835.jpeg?filename=moonfare_case_mockup-01.jpg) or [sitting with a dog](https://fiu-original.b-cdn.net/fontsinuse.com/use-images/N195/195834/195834.jpeg?filename=moonfare_case_mockup-02.jpg). According to [Pitchbook](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/Moonfare-ceo-retail-high-net-worth-individuals), 40% of Moonfare's investors were millennials in 2023.
   
   The company's website supports potential investors with blog articles and research to educate them about the private equity market and Moonfare's platform:

### SEC: "Accredited Investors" & "Qualified Purchasers"
Private equity investments - including those on Moonfare's platform - are only open to *accredited investors* and *qualified purchasers* in the United States. According to the [SEC](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investment-products/private-investment-funds/private-equity), individual accredited investors are defined as "financially sophisticated" - often having a high income ($200K+ single/$300K+ couple) and/or high net worth ($1M+). Institutional accredited investors are entities: family trusts, financial institutions and qualified staff, and companies with $5M in investments or assets. Qualified purchasers hold $5m+ in investments ($100m+ for institutions).

## Key Initiatives
* **Digital Platform for Secondary Private Equity Market:** Moonfare offered the ["first ever on-demand secondary market for individual private equity investors,"](https://www.moonfare.com/blog/moonfare-lexington-launch-digital-secondary-market) supported by their partnership with Lexington partners. This increases liquidity for its customers and attracts investors that may not want to wait until a buyout or until an investment matures. 
* **Transparent Policies and Fees:** [Moonfare](http://moonfare.com) has relatively low minimum investment requirements ($75k) which lowers the barrier to entry for individual customers who qualify as accredited investors, based on income or qualifications rather than high net-worth. Also, they have a transparent fee structure: a one-time fee for each allocation and a yearly management fee. This fee structure mimics that of mutual funds and would be more readily accepted by investors who are new to the private equity market than the membership fee that many private equity firms charge.
* **Marketing to Diverse Audiences:** In 2022, Moonfare [rebranded their website, platform, and marketing to better represent and communicate with its members](https://www.moonfare.com/blog/revealing-our-new-brands). The company's marketing materials now feature a relatively young, diverse cast. By focusing on younger clients, Moonfare can maintain profits even when their older client base's account balances diminish with age.


## KPIs & Competitors
According [a May 2023 report on Moonfare's website](https://www.moonfare.com/blog/moonfare-growth-2023), the company grew rapidly in the past year. Registered users increased 60% to 54,000. Assets under management (AUM) increased to €2.5B - up 50% in the last year with significant gains in the United States and Singapore. Moonfare also leads competitors in AUM.

## Technology
### Development & Implementation Process
[According to Elena Melashchenko](https://www.netguru.com/blog/tech-leadership-fintech-startup), Principle Engineer in Software Development, Moonfare uses *Scrum* and *Agile* collaborative frameworks in software development and implementation processes. The team uses *Slack* and *Google Meets* to communicate with each other and *Confluence* to document work.

### Collaboration & Stack
Moonfare works with consultants [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/tech-leadership-fintech-startup) for backend development and [Snapsoft](https://snapsoft.io/success-stories/snapsoft-helps-moonfare-make-high-yield-investing-more-accessible) to help with user operations. According to Snapsoft, "Moonfare uses the *Amazon Web Services* cloud platform to host the application, primarily utilizing *Elastic Kubernetes Service* and *AWS Lambda functions* along with the managed *Relational Database Service*, *DynamoDB*, and *CloudFront*. The vast majority of the application is written in *TypeScript*, using *React* for the webpage and various *NodeJS* based technologies for the backend services." Moonfare also uses [*Dremio*](https://www.dremio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cs_moonfare_EN.pdf), a data cloud lakehouse.


## Recommendation: Scale the US Market
Although Moonfare aims to democratize private equity markets, SEC regulations restrict individual investor access to high-net-worth individuals who qualify as accredited investors or qualified purchasers. This limitation impacts Moonfare's ability to add customers and increase profits in the US market.
### Complementary Offering: Crowdfunding
However, crowdfunding presents an opportunity to expand Moonfare's customer base, as it is accessible to all Americans. [The US leads the world in crowdfunding participation, with $73.6B raised in 2020](https://www.fundera.com/resources/crowdfunding-statistics), indicating a comfort level with this type of venture capital fundraising. According to [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib-crowdfunding) guidelines, non-accredited investors can invest between 5-10% of their income in crowdfunded ventures. **To increase its US assets under management (AUM) and broaden its customer base, Moonfare should consider offering smaller private equity investments through crowdfunding opportunities for new business ventures. This complementary offering would attract a wider range of investors and introduce accredited investors to Moonfare's brand, platform, and private equity investment opportunities.**

### Jellop: Adtech for Crowdfunding
Moonfare may be able to use their existing stack to run crowdfunding campaigns. However, to reach the number of investors required for a successful crowdfunding campaign, Moonfare needs to expand beyond their existing marketing strategy. Specifically, the company should market to broad audiences on social media and websites that are commonly used in the United States.

[Jellop's website](https://jellop.com/) advertises the company as "the Adtech behind the best Kickstarters" and explains that they advertise Crowdfunding projects on Facebook and Google. Currently, Jellop is only available to Kickstarter campaigns, but Moonfare could develop a strategic partnership with the firm and integrate the software into its platform to provide advertising as an add-on service that could generate more fee-based income for Moonfare. In effect, companies seeking funding would pay for Jellop's advertising, themselves, while simultaneously exposing more Americans to the Moonfare brand.
