      "In October 2021, Mayor Muriel Bowser appointed Jackie Reyes-Yanes as the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Community Affairs (MOCA). Director Reyes is the first Latina to be appointed to this position. Before serving as Director of MOCA, she served as the Director of the Mayor’s Office on Latino Affairs (MOLA) for 6 years.\n",
      "During her tenure as the first Salvadoran Director of the Mayor’s Office on Latino Affairs (MOLA), she was responsible for advocating and making the Latino community an integral part of the District of Columbia policy’s design and budget allocation. The mandate of the agency, which is part of the Executive Office of the Mayor, is to ensure that full range of health, education, employment, and social services are made available to Latino residents of the District of Columbia.\n",
      "Director Reyes-Yanes’ experience spans more than twenty years of commitment to the diverse growing Latino community. She has acted as the Latino Affairs and Community Outreach Director for late DC councilmember Jim Graham (D – Ward 1). While serving with Graham, Reyes spearheaded initiatives to address the needs of Latino residents in the District. Several of her accomplishments include organizing gang prevention events that successfully reduced street violence and crime and helping secure financing to rebuild the Monseñor Romero Apartments in Mount Pleasant which were destroyed by a fire in 2008. Additionally, Director Reyes-Yanes served the District’s Latino youth as a case manager at the Latin American Youth Center (LAYC) and in the Mayor’s Office of Community Relations and Services (MOCRS) under former Mayor Adrian Fenty.\n",
      "Director Reyes-Yanes is recognized throughout the District, National, and International for her efforts in creating safe spaces for the immigrant community through cultivating strategic partnerships with different stakeholders. Mrs. Reyes-Yanes has been featured in the “Si se Puede” Book 25 Successful Salvadoreans in Diaspora. Author Ana Margarita Chavez Escobar. Also, name En el Tiempo Latino Newspaper 100 Powermeter\n",
      "Director Reyes-Yanes has deep roots in the community and a track record of success working in support of causes that help the Latino community. She is a Ward 5 resident and Salvadorian activist. She made DC her home in 1990.\n",
